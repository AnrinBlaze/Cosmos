Getting Started
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To get started with this boilerplate, just download this as a zip or clone it and install a [Pokemon Showdown server][1] as you usually do.
If you forgot how to do this, here is a quick reference:

  git clone https://github.com/CreaturePhil/Showdown-Boilerplate.git showdown-boilerplate
  cd showdown-boilerplate
  npm install

Once you done that, create __usergroups.csv__, __about.csv__, __elo.csv__, __money.csv__, __lastSeen.csv__, and __tourWins.csv__ files in the _config_ folder.

To do this quickly in your terminal or command line:

On Windows:

  cd config
  Type NUL > usergroups.csv
  Type NUL > about.csv
  Type NUL > elo.csv
  Type NUL > money.csv
  Type NUL > lastSeen.csv
  Type NUL > tourWins.csv
  cd ..

On Linux or Mac:

  cd config
  touch usergroups.csv about.csv elo.csv money.csv lastSeen.csv tourWins.csv
  cd ..

`cd ..` is to go back to the showdown-boilerplate directory.
Once you get your server up and running, you can manage certain settings with the `/controlpanel` or `/cp` command.
